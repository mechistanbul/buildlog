# Build Log for mechanical keyboard projects for mechistanbul group

## How to contribute

Create folders according to your keyboard, github user name and revisions you make on your own project. Build logs are general progress logs for building a certain keyboard based on your preference and maintained in a README.md file just like this one!

## Build log structure

Build logs basically have a custom bill of materials and additional tools used with your build to make your life easier and steps you took to finish up the final product. This should be built on top of other designs, and show what is different with your build.

Bill of Materials contains the components and materials required for the mechanical keyboard you chose. You can just copy over the original bill of materials for referencing them in your project and include your custom additions.

Makings section will be consisting of all steps of creating the build and putting the final product together. As we will be forking those keyboard projects for reference, you may start building them based on their logs and add here what differs in your build.
