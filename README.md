# Build Log for mechanical keyboard projects in mechistanbul

## How to contribute

Create folders according to your keyboard, github user name and revisions you make on your own project. Build logs are general progress logs for building a certain keyboard based on your preference and maintained in a README.md file just like this one!

You can place the additional project files along with your readme.md under

/buildlog/keyboardname/username/revision/...

## Build log structure

Build logs basically have a custom **bill of materials** and **additional tools** sections used with your build to make your life easier and **steps you took** to finish up the final product. This should be built on top of other designs, and show what is different with your build. You can also fill in the gaps left by the previous project owners add details you came by when building it.

**Bill of Materials** contains the components and materials required for the mechanical keyboard you chose. You can just copy over the original bill of materials for referencing them in your project and include your custom additions. This can be anything as long as they are actually consumed when making the build. This also is a purchase list for practical applications for others.

**Steps taken** section will be consisting of all steps of creating the build and putting the final product together. As we will be forking those keyboard projects for reference, you may start building them based on their logs and add here what differs in your build.

Adding pictures, illustrations and photos are welcome for this part as this basically will help others going through the same procedure.
