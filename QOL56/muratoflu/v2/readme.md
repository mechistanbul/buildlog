# Creating a ZMK shield for QOL56
## Background and story
As I was playing with a shiny new Nice Nano v2 I got my hands on (For a nice nano and its v2 model please check: https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/), it was just a matter of time before I would get one into the QOL56. So this was more of an answer to my curiosity of "can it be done?"

## Problems
### Pinout
The first thing you would start worrying about is the pinout of Nice Nano and how it will align with the pro micro and how the configuration for it is. Apparently, nice nano does support QMK but I would really like to carry this around without worrying about cables and all so it had to be backed by battery and bluetooth connectivity.
### Placement
The next thing to worry about is the battery placement. I decided to make it even in the middle so I would not need another set of plastics and not much to add to the weight either. The battery should be in a place where I could easily get it replaced if something goes bad and not worry about problems with it.
### ZMK configuration
I would not like to tell this, but it turns that the backend for ZMK is written so much better with its reusability and cleanliness in mind. It just takes a bit more to get your head around it. Once you know the basic principles of how the board is laid out, it is actually pretty simple to get it done.
